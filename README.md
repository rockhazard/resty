# Resty: Query Domain Status Codes

### Come Again?

This generates a report of status codes for given domains names, either singly or from a return-separated text list, as seen in the testurls.txt file.

### Why?

So folks can figure out if their domains are working properly.

### Usage

type `rest.py -h` at a terminal.
