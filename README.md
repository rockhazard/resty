# Resty: Query Domain Status Codes

### Come Again?

This generates a report of status codes for given domain names, either singly or from a return-separated text list, as seen in the testurls.txt file.

### Why?

So folks can figure out if their domains are working properly.

### Usage

type `rest.py -h` at a terminal.

### ToDo

- Prune bookmark files of dead links
- Accept json and csv files as input
- Output report in json, csv, and plain text file, instead of just to stdout.
